1) Getting Started -
Git is a Distributed Version Control System which saves the snapshot
It has SHA1 integrity and Local work is done
It has three phases - Modified(Changed file but not commited to database), Staged(Marked a modified file to go in next snapshot) and Commited(Data stored to local database .git)
Setup - 	git config --global user.name "Akash Dhanwar"
		git config --global user.email akash.dhanwar112@gmail.com
		git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"	---->	To specify favourite editor
		git config --global init.defaultBranch main	---->	Set default branch name
		git config --list	---->	Check settings
		git help config		---->	Get help of a command
		
		git log --oneline	----> logs


2) Git Basics -
Creating a git repo	-	git init
					git add LICENSE						-	Staging a tracked/untracked file
					git commit -m 'Initial project version'
					git clone <url> dirName

*	git ls-files			---->		List files in staging area
*	git status			---->		Check status
	git status -s			---->		Short status
*	git diff filename		---->		Difference between Working directory file and staging area file
								DESCRIPTION -
								diff --git A/Git.txt B/Git.txt 		- A is staging file and B is directory file
								index 279aee1..d40b054 100644  		- A's hash 279aee1, B's hash d40b054, 100644 is mode of file - 100 is file type and 644 is file permissions
								--- a/Git.txt				- Source file(staging file) A missing some lines
								+++ b/Git.txt				- Destinaton file(Directory file) extra line additions
								@@ -24,8 +24,8 @@ 			- -24 means lines missing in source(staging area) ans +24 is of directory file
	git diff HEAD filename			---->		Difference between Working Directory and last commit in local repository(HEAD)
 	git diff --staged HEAD filename		---->		Difference between staged file and last commit
	git diff --cached HEAD filename		---->		Difference between staged file and last commit
	git diff commitid filename		---->		Differences between Working Directory and specific commitid
	git diff --cached commitid filename	---->		Differences between Staging file and specific commitid
	git diff commitid1 commitid2 filename---->		Differences between teo commits
*	cat .gitignore				---->		Used to ignore some files
*	git commit -m "message"			---->		Commit
	git commit -am "msg"			---->		Stage and Commit
*	git rm filename				---->		Deletes the file from directory and staging
		 filename -f -r			---->		Deletes the file from directory and staging
	git rm filename --cached		---->		Removes only from staging area
